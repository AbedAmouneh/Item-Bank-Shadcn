# Project: Item Bank (Nx Monorepo)

---

## Who is reading this code

The developer working on this project is learning both frontend and backend
development. They have basic JavaScript knowledge but rely on Claude for
most of the implementation.

---

## Teaching rule — ALWAYS follow this

Before writing or editing any file, explain what you are about to do in
plain English. Keep it short — 2 to 4 sentences maximum. Use a simple
analogy if the concept is abstract. Then write the code.

After finishing a file, add one sentence saying what role it plays in the
bigger picture (e.g. "This hook is the bridge — the component asks it for
data, and it handles all the API communication behind the scenes.").

**Never use a technical term without explaining it the first time it appears.**

Example of the format to follow:

> "I'm about to create the AuthContext. Think of it as a backpack the whole
> app carries around — once you log in, your user info goes into the backpack,
> and any component can reach in and grab it without asking the server again."
> [writes the code]
> "This context sits at the top of the app so every component below it can
> read the current user without any extra work."

## Stack

- **Monorepo**: Nx v22
- **App**: `apps/item-bank` — React 19 + TypeScript (strict) + Vite
- **Libs**: `libs/ui`, `libs/auth`, `libs/questions`, `libs/profile`, `libs/i18n`, `libs/types`, `libs/api`, `libs/config`
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4 + shadcn/ui + Radix UI primitives
- **Package manager**: pnpm — never use npm or yarn
- **Forms**: react-hook-form + Zod — never replace, restructure, or modify this logic
- **Rich text / canvas / DnD**: TinyMCE, Konva, dnd-kit — never touch their internals, only replace MUI wrapper shells
- **Server state**: TanStack Query (`useQuery` / `useMutation`)
- **UI state**: React Context

## Architecture & Library Boundaries

### Lib Layer Order (lower libs cannot import from higher ones)

```
apps/item-bank          ← top: imports anything
  libs/questions
  libs/profile
  libs/auth
    libs/ui             ← shared primitives (shadcn, hooks, utils)
    libs/api            ← all API calls centralized here
    libs/types          ← all shared TypeScript types/interfaces/DTOs
    libs/config         ← env vars and typed config constants
    libs/i18n           ← NEVER TOUCH — translation infrastructure only
```

- A lib may only import from libs **at or below its own layer**
- `libs/questions` cannot import from `libs/auth` or `libs/profile`
- All libs import shadcn primitives via `@item-bank/ui` — never from a local `components/ui/`

### Folder Structure Inside Each Lib

```
libs/<name>/src/
  features/
    <feature-name>/
      index.ts          ← barrel re-exports everything from this feature
      <Feature>.tsx     ← main component
      <SubComponent>.tsx
      hooks/
        use<HookName>.ts
      types.ts          ← feature-local types (or use libs/types for shared)
  index.ts              ← lib-level barrel (re-exports all features)
```

### Shared Component Location

- shadcn/Radix primitives → **always** `libs/ui/src/components/ui/` — no exceptions
- Shared hooks → `libs/ui/src/hooks/`
- App-level components (NavBar, Sidebar) → `libs/ui/src/components/`

### Types

- All shared interfaces and DTOs → `libs/types`
- Inline `type Props = {...}` is allowed only for component-local prop types in the same file
- Never define a shared type inside a feature component

### API Layer

- All fetch/mutation logic lives in `libs/api`
- Feature components consume API via TanStack Query hooks wrapping `libs/api` functions
- TanStack Query error states (`isError`, `error`) provide inline error UI — no separate error handling layer for API errors

### Routing

- Each lib owns its route definitions
- `apps/item-bank` assembles routes from lib exports
- `ProtectedRoute` in `libs/auth` acts as layout wrapper with `<Outlet />`

### Config & Environment

- Env variables: `import.meta.env.VITE_*` (Vite convention)
- All constants flow through a typed config module in `libs/config` — never hard-code env values in components

### New Libs

- Create with: `pnpm nx generate @nx/react:library`
- Never scaffold a new lib without explicit task requirement

---

## Language

Always respond in **English only**, regardless of what language the user writes in.

---

## Verbosity

Walk through every notable decision. Explain the approach, flag risks, and summarize changes in a table when multiple files are touched.

---

## Commit Messages

**Imperative short** format — no conventional prefix:

```
Add login page
Fix table border in dark mode
Remove MUI Box from ProtectedRoute
```

No `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` prefixes.

**Atomic commits — one commit per file or logical unit.** Never batch multiple component migrations into a single commit. Each migrated file, each bug fix, each i18n update, and each test change gets its own commit. This applies to all migration phases and ongoing work.

---

## Branching

- `feat/description` for new features and migrations
- `fix/description` for bug fixes
- Never push directly to `main` without completing the task

---

## After Every Task

Always run `pnpm nx build item-bank` to verify nothing broke before considering the task complete. If the build fails, fix it — do not leave a broken build.

---

## TypeScript

- **Strict** — no implicit `any`, no `@ts-ignore`, no `as unknown as X` casts
- Always fix type errors properly; never suppress them
- Use `UseFormRegisterReturn` for RHF register spreads, not `any`
- All component prop types defined explicitly — no inferred untyped props

---

## File Naming

- `PascalCase.tsx` for all files (components, pages, hooks, utils)
- Exception: `index.ts` barrels are always lowercase

---

## Import Order (inside every file)

1. React and React hooks
2. Third-party packages (lucide-react, react-hook-form, zod, @tanstack/*, etc.)
3. Workspace packages (`@item-bank/*`)
4. Relative imports (`./`, `../`)

Enforce this order; reorganize imports in any file you touch.

---

## Component Size & Extraction

- Extract sub-components when a file exceeds **~150 lines** or when logic is reused
- Each feature folder exposes an **index barrel** (`index.ts`) re-exporting everything

---

## CSS & Styling

- **Always** use logical CSS properties: `start-*`, `end-*`, `ps-*`, `pe-*`, `ms-*`, `me-*`
- Never use `left-*`, `right-*`, `pl-*`, `pr-*`, `ml-*`, `mr-*`
- Dark mode via **`dark:` Tailwind prefix** (`darkMode: 'class'`, `.dark` on `<html>`)
- CSS custom property naming: `--component-role` (e.g. `--choice-item-background`)
- New tokens must be added to **both** `:root` (light) and `.dark` blocks in `apps/item-bank/src/styles.css`
- CSS variable values are bare HSL: `239 68% 68%` — consumed as `hsl(var(--token))`
- Exception: gradient tokens use the full `linear-gradient(...)` value and are consumed with `background: var(--token)` directly

---

## i18n

- Always add translation keys to **both** `public/locales/en/*.json` and `public/locales/ar/*.json`
- Reuse existing keys wherever possible before adding new ones
- Never leave a `t('...')` call in code without the corresponding JSON entry

---

## Component Migration Rules (MUI → Tailwind)

- Full freedom to redesign prop APIs — MUI-specific types (`SelectChangeEvent`, `SxProps`, etc.) must be removed
- Never leave `styled()`, `alpha()`, `useTheme()`, or any `@mui/*` import
- TinyMCE, Konva, dnd-kit internals are **never touched** — only their MUI shell wrappers are replaced
- react-hook-form + Zod logic is **never modified**

---

## Accessibility

Follow **WCAG AA** standards:

- Always add `aria-label` on icon-only buttons
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.)
- Ensure keyboard navigation works (focus rings, tab order)
- Manage focus explicitly when modals open/close

---

## Hooks

- Shared hooks → `libs/ui/src/hooks/`
- Feature-specific hooks → `hooks/` subfolder inside the feature folder
- Hook files named `use<HookName>.tsx` (PascalCase after `use`)

---

## Comments & Documentation

- Add `//` comments for any non-obvious logic
- JSDoc for all exported functions and components
- Variables and functions must be self-explanatory — no single-letter names outside of standard map/filter callbacks

---

## TODOs

Never leave `TODO`, `FIXME`, or `HACK` comments. Either implement it or don't — no placeholders.

---

## console.log

Remove all `console.log` statements before finishing a task. No debug logging in committed code.

---

## Tests

- Always update or add tests when modifying component logic
- Do not leave existing tests broken
- Run `pnpm nx test item-bank` after changes that affect tested code

---

## Error Handling

- API errors handled via TanStack Query `isError` / `error` states
- Display inline error UI in the component — no global error toast for query failures
- Use React Error Boundaries at the route level for unexpected runtime errors

---

## Bug Discovery

If a pre-existing bug is found while working on something else, fix it **in the same commit** — don't leave known bugs.

---

## Off-Limits Files

Never modify these regardless of context:

- `libs/i18n/` — translation infrastructure is stable
- `tsconfig.base.json` — path aliases; changes break all workspace imports
- `node_modules/`, `.nx/` — never touch generated or cache directories

## Commit Rules

- Never commit `.md` files — documentation and notes stay out of version control
- Exception: `CLAUDE.md` itself is the only `.md` file that may be committed
- Never add `Co-Authored-By` trailers to commit messages — keep Abed as the sole author
